        During my time at School of Code we were shown Canvas. I enjoyed making
        pictures as it proved to be a good stress reliever, sometimes SoC can
        get a bit overwhelming (no offense meant, its still a fun course).

        If you want to see them visit the different pictures in the nav 😃

      <p className="text">👍 Hope you like them I had fun making them...</p>
