        During my time at School of Code we were shown Canvas. I enjoyed making
        the pictures as it proved to be a good stress reliever, sometimes SoC
        can get a bit overwhelming (no offense meant, its still a fun course).

      <p className="text">
        If you want to see them visit the different pictures in the nav 😃
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <p className="text">👍 Hope you like them I had fun making them...</p>
    </div>
